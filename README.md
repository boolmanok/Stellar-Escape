Welcome to Stellar Escape! You are Maxewell, one of the 5 genius' sent to Mars to investigate and locate what might be a source of water. During the investigation, a discovery was found by one of Maxwell's companions when he was out on a surface run. What he brought back was enough to convince the team to go back to the spot and check out the source. 

While the team was in the cave of the source, a sound of madness came from the entrance, distorting all of their realities. Maxwell, the noobie of the team, foud himself in an abyss of Mars. He could hear his teammates above him yelling at him to get to them, and that he was the key to saving them all. Deep inside, madness was slowly taking his brain over, and he knew what he had to do before he ran out of time. Could he make it to the top?

Or was he imagining it all, stuck in the loop of madness, forever? 

Stellar Escape is a 2d platformer, where the player will jump his way up to try and escape the abyss and outrun the madness attempting to spread throughout his brain and take him and his team over.
The main goal is to escape, but the key here is that the win condition (the height needed to escape / will be based off score) is     unknown (you're literally being driven crazy from the madness, and even if you weren't how would you know how deep you are? Come on..). 
You may be able to reach the win condition (score needed to win), or you may be stuck in the never ending loop, but you'll never know. 

Unless you choose to look in the code for it I guess.
